> **Casinos on this list aren’t here because of personal preference—they’re here because I’ve reviewed enough credible evidence to believe they may be unsafe. we don’t share all that evidence on demand, as we expect everyone to do their own due diligence. A single successful cashout doesn’t guarantee a casino is trustworthy. Our decisions are made with the community’s safety in mind, and we ask that you trust that our only goal is to protect everyone’s best interests, and watch to all get rich!**

**Why a Casino May Be Considered Not Reputable:**    
      
**A casino can be added to this list for a variety of reasons. Even if some players report good experiences, repeated or credible red flags can indicate serious risks. Common issues include:**    
    
- **Withdrawal Problems** – Unreasonable delays, sudden account “verification” hurdles after wins, or outright refusal to pay legitimate winnings.        
- **Changing Terms After a Win** – Altering bonus terms, wagering requirements, or other conditions retroactively to avoid payouts.        
- **Unclear or Predatory Bonus Rules** – Hidden conditions, extremely high wagering requirements, or rules designed to make bonus funds nearly impossible to withdraw.        
- **Unresolved Player Complaints** – A pattern of ignoring or dismissing customer concerns without fair resolution.        
- **Fake or Weak Licensing** – Operating under unverified, expired, or non-reputable regulatory licenses.        
- **Misleading Marketing** – False claims about payouts, promotions, or player odds.        
- **Targeting Vulnerable Players** – Aggressive retention tactics, constant unsolicited offers, or ignoring responsible gambling requests.        
- **Security Concerns** – Poor data protection practices, suspicious payment processors, or lack of secure website encryption.        
      
**These issues can exist even if a player manages to cash out successfully once or twice. A single payout does not erase systemic problems or remove long-term risk.**

**Frequently Asked Questions:**      
      
**Q: Can a casino be removed from the list?**      
> A: *Yes. If new credible evidence shows a casino operates fairly and safely, it will be reviewed and potentially removed.*        
      
      
**Q: Why don’t you share all the evidence publicly?**        
> A: *To protect user privacy, avoid unnecessary drama, and because I expect everyone to do their own research. I’m happy to discuss concerns but won’t do the research for everyone.*        
      
      
**Q: Does a successful cashout mean a casino is safe?**        
> A: *No. Some casinos pay out occasionally to maintain appearances but may have systemic issues that harm players in the long run.*
