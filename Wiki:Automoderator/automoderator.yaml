  If you wanna flex you're going to need to repost this as either a picture submission, or video submission. If you want to flex the replay URL, you can add it to the body. — **why you ask? because a flex should be visual.**

  You’re currently using the **Discussion|Q&A flair**,  so this is a quick reminder about the helpful tool /u/answeredbot. If your post is a **question** and someone provides a **satisfactory answer**, you can acknowledge it by replying to their comment with **!answered** ￩ exactly as you see it right here. ^(**! answered** works too).
  
  This makes it easier for others with the same question to find the solution quickly and efficiently.
  
  If your post is intended purely for **discussion** and not seeking a specific answer, feel free to disregard this message and continue the conversation.

  # Hey /u/{{author}},  
     
  I noticed you only posted a link without any text, Next time you post a url without text please do it like this:  
     
  ### Mobile Phones:  
  Use the &#x1f517; for your url submissions. [Example](https://imgur.com/a/QSF4etg#DJvbFrh).  
   - If you decide you need to add text to the body of the post you're able to do so while using the &#x1f517;.
  ### Desktop:  
   Use the link submission [img](https://imgur.com/sKBJg4n#sKBJg4n).
   - If you decide you need to add text to the body of the post you'll need to use the text submission and paste your URL in the body along with any text instead of Link submission. [img](https://imgur.com/yiB7S5g#yiB7S5g).

  # Hey /u/{{author}},  
     
  I noticed you didn't submit a link post, instead you just posted a url and text, This is fine if you're posting on reddit from **desktop**, or posting multiple links.

  If you're posting from **mobile device** it's best if you submit like this:
   - Use the &#x1f517; for your link submissions. [Example](https://imgur.com/a/QSF4etg#DJvbFrh) and then add the text in the body.

  You're not in trouble and won't be banned or anything crazy it just helps when posts look cleaner.

  Your {{kind}} was removed because you bypassed a word ({{match}}) on the **[Blacklisted Casino List](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasinoFreebies/wiki/the_list)**. breaking **[Rule #2](https://reddit.com/r/CasinoFreebies/w/the_rules/2)**
  
  If this is your first violation, it's only a temp (7 day), ban.
  
  If you violate a 2nd time, you're going to get permanently banned.

  # Hey /u/{{author}},
  
  We're trying something new at /r/CasinoFreebies for Carnival Citi posts that include a free SC code.  
  
  Simply **repost using the URL below**, placing the code directly after the final `/`:

  `https://www.carnivalciti.com/home/bonusing/code/`

  If you're unsure how to do a link submission, check out the examples below.

  ### Mobile Phones:  
  Use the &#x1f517; icon when submitting your link.  
    
  ➤ [&#x1f4f7; Example Image](https://imgur.com/a/QSF4etg#DJvbFrh)

  - You **can** add text to the body when using the &#x1f517; method.

  ### Desktop:  
  Use the link submission option.  
    
  ➤ [&#x1f4f7; Example Image](https://imgur.com/sKBJg4n#sKBJg4n)  
  - If you want to include body text, use a **text post** instead, and paste the full URL along with your text.

  instead of spamming the subreddit with a offtopic post about why your post keeps getting removed, you should  
  
  1. check your direct messages for any messages from Automoderator.  
  2. if there isn't anything from Automoderator in your direct messages,  **[contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/CasinoFreebies)** so the issue can be addressed accordingly and fixed if needed.

  # Hey /u/{{author}}, thank you for being apart of /r/CasinoFreebies, but farewell.  
    
  Your {{kind}} has been permanently removed.
    
  We hate to be the bearer of bad news but your account has the lowest **[CQS Ranking](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/s/nEpUJU31Hi)** possible &/or your account is [shadowbanned](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045734911-My-account-was-banned-for-spam-inauthentic-activity-or-ban-evasion), please check out these links so you understand. This decision is not ours at /r/CasinoFreebies, it is Reddit alone that has flagged your account.   
    
  For the safety of our community we are going to have to ban you, I myself as a bot cannot do this deed, the mods will when they get the chance.  
    
  All this means is you will not be able to post or comment anymore. you can still continue to collect all the freebies from the subreddit like normal.  
    
  Thank you for understanding,

  ### /u/{{author}} has been flagged as lowest CQS.  
    
  # Ban immediately!  
  if they're shadowbanned it'll say:  
  > `Whoops
  > Something went wrong`  
    
  **and you won't be able to ban them like you do normally..**  
    - in this situation you need to manually go to mod tools ￫ banned and add them manually (dont type the u/)  
    - select rule `Harassment/bullying` then you can select ban message.  
    - next i now mute them, if they're shadowbanned It'll say username doesn't exist. so unfortunately we can't mute shadowbanned but we can ban them.

  Hello! Thanks for your interest in the [casino blacklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasinoFreebies/wiki/blacklisted_casinos/the_list).

  Please know that this list is created to protect the community based on credible evidence and player safety. While some players may have had good experiences, the list reflects broader patterns of issues such as withdrawal delays, unfair terms, or unresolved complaints.

  We do not share all evidence publicly to respect privacy and avoid confusion. If you have concerns or specific evidence about a casino, please use the official reporting template or contact the moderators.

  Your understanding helps us keep this community safe and trustworthy!

  &#9888;&#65039; **Reminder:**  
  This is a **freebies** subreddit — not a *redemption support* or *“do they pay?”* help desk.  
  
  Posts asking about payment delays, verifications, or “how long until I get it?” are automatically flagged.  
  We focus on **finding and sharing new casino freebies**, not troubleshooting redemptions or payouts.  
  
  &#x1f4a1; **Tip:**  
  If you’re waiting on a payout, check the site’s own FAQ or support team — response times vary, and other members can’t speed that up for you.  
  
  Thanks for helping keep the feed clean and focused on the fun stuff — the actual **freebies.**
