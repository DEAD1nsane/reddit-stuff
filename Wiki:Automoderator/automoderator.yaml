  # Hey /u/{{author}},  
     
  I noticed you only posted a link without any text, Next time you post a url without text please do it like this:  
     
  ### Mobile Phones:  
  Use the &#x1f517; for your url submissions. [Example](https://imgur.com/a/QSF4etg#DJvbFrh).  
   - If you decide you need to add text to the body of the post you're able to do so while using the &#x1f517;.
  ### Desktop:  
   Use the link submission [img](https://imgur.com/sKBJg4n#sKBJg4n).
   - If you decide you need to add text to the body of the post you'll need to use the text submission and paste your URL in the body along with any text instead of Link submission. [img](https://imgur.com/yiB7S5g#yiB7S5g).

  # Hey /u/{{author}},  
     
  I noticed you didn't submit a link post, instead you just posted a url and text, This is fine if you're posting on reddit from **desktop**, or posting multiple links.

  If you're posting from **mobile device** it's best if you submit like this:
   - Use the &#x1f517; for your link submissions. [Example](https://imgur.com/a/QSF4etg#DJvbFrh) and then add the text in the body.

  You're not in trouble and won't be banned or anything crazy it just helps when posts look cleaner.

  # Hey /u/{{author}},
  
  We're trying something new at /r/CasinoFreebies for Carnival Citi posts that include a free SC code.  
  
  Simply **repost using the URL below**, placing the code directly after the final `/`:

  `https://www.carnivalciti.com/home/bonusing/code/`

  If you're unsure how to do a link submission, check out the examples below.

  ### Mobile Phones:  
  Use the &#x1f517; icon when submitting your link.  
    
  ➤ [&#x1f4f7; Example Image](https://imgur.com/a/QSF4etg#DJvbFrh)

  - You **can** add text to the body when using the &#x1f517; method.

  ### Desktop:  
  Use the link submission option.  
    
  ➤ [&#x1f4f7; Example Image](https://imgur.com/sKBJg4n#sKBJg4n)  
  - If you want to include body text, use a **text post** instead, and paste the full URL along with your text.

  instead of spamming the subreddit with a offtopic post about why your post keeps getting removed, you should  
  1. check your direct messages for any messages from Automoderator.  

  2. if there isn't anything from Automoderator in your direct messages,  **[contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/CasinoFreebies)** so the issue can be addressed accordingly and fixed if needed.

  Your {{kind}} is currently not visible because of your **[CQS Ranking being Low](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/s/nEpUJU31Hi)**, meaning your close to possibly getting [shadowbanned](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045734911-My-account-was-banned-for-spam-inauthentic-activity-or-ban-evasion) & are labeled as a reputation risk.

  We hate to be the bearer of bad news but your account has the lowest **[CQS Ranking](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/s/nEpUJU31Hi)** possible &/or your account is [shadowbanned](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045734911-My-account-was-banned-for-spam-inauthentic-activity-or-ban-evasion), please check out these links so you understand.

  For the safety of our community we are going to have to ban you, I myself as a bot cannot do this deed, the mods will when they get the chance.  
  
  All this means is you will not be able to post or comment anymore. you can still continue to collect all the freebies from the subreddit like normal.

  # /u/{{author}} has been flagged as lowest CQS user.
  
  Ban immediately (if they're shadowbanned it'll say removed by reddit systems and you won't be able to ban them like you do normally..
    - in this situation you need to manually go to mod tools > banned and add them manually.
    - select rule Harassment/bullying then you can select ban message.
    
    but don't worry about muting, we wanna hear their cries and excuses lol.

  Hello! Thanks for your interest in the [casino blacklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasinoFreebies/wiki/blacklisted_casinos/the_list).
